## 🏥 **Scenario – Use Case**  
Modern hospitals aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce reporting delays by integrating **AI-based medical imaging analysis** (e.g., X-ray, MRI, CT).  
The system uses **deep learning models** to detect anomalies, flag urgent cases, and assist radiologists.

✅ **Main Objectives:**  
- ⚡ Speed up diagnosis and reduce reporting time by 40%  
- 🧠 Increase detection accuracy for conditions like tumors and fractures  
- 🩺 Assist doctors with decision support while maintaining ethical standards  
- 🔒 Ensure patient data privacy through secure storage and compliance (HIPAA/GDPR)

**🎯 Target Audience:**  
Hospital administrators, radiologists, and healthcare policy makers.

## 🧩 **Prompt Designs for Each Type**

### 1️⃣ Comparative Analysis Prompt  
> **Prompt:**  
🔍 *"Compare and contrast AI-based radiology image analysis with traditional manual radiologist review in terms of accuracy, speed, and ethical considerations."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Similarities: Both aim for accurate diagnosis  
- Differences: AI offers rapid pre-screening; manual review provides nuanced judgment  
- Ethical aspects: bias, explainability, patient consent

---

### 2️⃣ Experiential Perspective Prompt  
> **Prompt:**  
👩‍⚕️ *"As a senior radiologist, describe your first year of using an AI-assisted imaging platform. How did it change your workflow, accuracy, and patient communication?"*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- First-person narrative  
- Practical benefits and challenges (false positives, trust issues)  
- Quantifiable improvements (e.g., 30% faster reporting)

---

### 3️⃣ Everyday Functioning Prompt  
> **Prompt:**  
📱 *"Explain AI medical imaging to a high-school student by comparing it to the way smartphone photo apps automatically detect faces and adjust lighting."*

- Highlights pattern recognition and real-time analysis  
- Easy for a non-technical audience

---

### 4️⃣ Universal Prompt Structure  
> **Prompt:**  
📖 *"Explain step by step how an AI system processes an MRI scan—from image capture to anomaly detection and final report generation."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Data acquisition  
- Pre-processing & noise removal  
- Model inference  
- Radiologist review  
- Secure report delivery

---

### 5️⃣ Prompt Size Limitation  
> **Prompt:**  
📏 *"List 50 medical imaging modalities where AI is being applied."*  
➡ **Refined Prompt:**  
*"List 10 AI applications in medical imaging at a time until you cover 50."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Batches of 10 for readability  
- Covers diverse areas (cardiology, oncology, orthopedics…)

---

### ➕ Critical Thinking / Problem-Solving Prompt *(optional)*  
> **Prompt:**  
🧠 *"An AI model shows sudden performance drops on MRI scans from a new machine. Propose a diagnostic workflow to identify the cause and maintain service continuity."*
